From his Los Angeles studio, he works with a broad range of clients mixing music projects, documentary and short films, and consulting on all things audio and music related.  A student of recording history and technique Epstein utilizes an extensive and carefully curated collection of the latest in software, vintage outboard processing, and synthesizers, marrying classic warmth to state of the art technology. After getting his start in high school as a sought after DJ in his native Boston and interning at The Cars’ famed studio, Syncro Sound, Epstein moved to NYC in the late 90's to work at Sony Music Studios under some of the world’s best engineers. In 2002, Epstein relocated to LA and released the cult classic record ‘Silver Clouds’ under the name Photocall.  Licensed by Clone, it continues to be spun by tastemaking DJs worldwide.  In addition to his mixing and consulting work, Epstein continues to release original music as Photocall (with Terryn Westbrook) and Cazion (with Jimmy Maheras).   An expert in project management and collaborative teamwork Epstein elicits the best results for each individually-tailored project.  Recent projects include mixing the Tribeca Film Festival selected documentary, Other Music, about the seminal record store in New York's east village. Current and past clients include , Ghostly International, Into The Woods, Fab 5 Freddy, Kim Ann Foxman, Sfire and The New York Times</h6>
